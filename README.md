Customer Churn Prediction for SyriaTel
This project focuses on building a classification model to predict customer churn for SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. Churn prediction helps identify customers who are likely to stop using the service, allowing the company to take proactive retention measures.
Data Source:(telecom churn dataset): Contains customer account details, usage metrics, service plans, and whether or not the customer churned.
Tools & Technologies
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Environment:   Vs code 
Version Control: Git, GitHub
Visualization: PowerPoint for presentation-ready insights
Problem Statement: Build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn (leave SyriaTel). The main business goal is to reduce revenue loss by identifying customers at high risk and targeting them with retention strategies.
Methodology
Data Understanding: Explored distributions, correlations, and class imbalance.
Data Cleaning: Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., customer ID), applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical variables.
Modeling: Trained multiple models: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Decision Tree
Applied hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
Evaluation: Evaluated using Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall, ROC Curve
Interpretation: Identified key features influencing churn: international plan, customer service calls, total day minutes
Recommendations: Provide actionable insights to reduce churn based on model findings
